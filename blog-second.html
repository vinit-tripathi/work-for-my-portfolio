            <p><strong>Semantic HTML</strong> is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the
                information in
                webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is
                processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its
                presentation to human users. HTML has included semantic markup since its inception. In an HTML
                document, the author may, among other things, "start with a title; add headings and paragraphs; add
                emphasis to [the] text; add images; add links to other pages; [and] use various kinds of lists".



                In 2001, Tim Berners-Lee participated in a discussion of the Semantic Web, where it was
                presented that intelligent software 'agents' might one day automatically trawl the Web and
                find, filter and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of end
                users. Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0,
                mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between these
                web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current
                aggregation and hybridisation of information is usually designed in by web developers, who
                already know the web locations and the API semantics of the specific data they wish to mash,
                compare and combine.

                An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without
                prior knowledge of what it might find, is the Web crawler or search-engine spider. These
                software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use
                various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide
                web users with search facilities.

                In order for search-engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text
                they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids, as well
                as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in
                HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of published
                information.

                While the true semantic web may depend on complex RDF ontologies and metadata, every HTML
                document makes its contribution to the meaningfulness of the Web by the correct use of
                headings, lists, titles and other semantic markup wherever possible. This "plain" use of
                HTML has been called "Plain Old Semantic HTML" or POSH. The correct use of Web 2.0
                'tagging' creates folksonomies that may be equally or even more meaningful to many. HTML
                5 introduced new semantic elements such as section, article, footer, progress, nav, aside,
                mark, and time. Overall, the goal of the W3C is to slowly introduce more ways for
                browsers, developers, and crawlers to better distinguish between different types of data,
                allowing for benefits such as better display on browsers on different devices.

                Presentational elements were not formally deprecated in HTML 4.01 and XHTML recommendations,
                but were recommended against. In HTML 5, some of those elements are
                still specified as their meaning has been clearly defined "as to be stylistically offset
                from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance".</p>
